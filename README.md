# Analysis-and-Design-of-Deep-Neural-Networks

This repositories include python codes for the following projects:

• Exploring various regularization methods such as, drop out, normalization, data augmentation, etc.(skip connection folder)

• Exploring skip connection in CNNs and implementing various networks like Res-Net U-net, etc. for classification tasks(skip connection folder)

• Comparision and implemention of various metric loses(Triplet-loss,cosine similarity,etc.) forbetter representation in CNNs and classification using nearest neighbor method(represenation learning folder)

• Fine tuning and comparison of VGG16, ResNet18, EffientNetB0 on Cifar10, Cifar100, Fashion-MNIST datasets(Comparison of various networks and datasets folder)
